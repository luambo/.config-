        -> Set of rules that governs communication.

    Syntax: structure or format of data. ( simple protocol expects: 1ª 8 bits sender, 2ª 8 bits receiver, rest: message) 
    
    Semantics: meaning of each section of bits.

    Timing: 2 characteristics: when data should be sent, how fast it can be sent.
